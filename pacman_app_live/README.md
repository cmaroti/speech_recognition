# Ms. Pacman App

To play my voice-controlled Pacman game, download the files and run `python pacman2.py` from the terminal.

Then go to [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000/). Make sure the microphone is enabled through the browser. The app has only been tested in Google Chrome.

You should now be able to play Ms. Pacman by giving the commands "up," "down," "left," and "right."
